The Common is a project focused on various aspects of resuable Java components. It is principal goal is to try new things! Therefore, if I found a good thrid-party package that can fulfill the same function, I would rather to reuse it, unless I feel interested to know how they work.

I welcome participation from all that are interested, at all skill levels. Coding, documentation and testing are all critical parts of the softeware development process. If you are interested in participating in any of these aspects, please join me!
